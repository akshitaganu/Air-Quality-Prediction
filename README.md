Employing the Air Quality Index (AQI) and machine learning approaches, the research aims to forecast air quality levels and provide significant environmental conditions insights. utilizing past information on air quality, such as pollution concentrations (e.g., CO, PM2.5, PM10, etc.)
The project aims to advance environmental sustainability by enhancing awareness of the factors influencing air pollution and enabling timely responses through the use of machine learning to forecast air quality.
